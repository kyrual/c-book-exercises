/*
The example also shows an else, which specifies an alternative action if the condition part of an if statement is false. The general form is

if (expression)
    statement1
else
    statement2

One and only one of the two statements associated with an if-else is performed.
If the expression is true, statement1 is executed; if not, statement2 is executed.
Each statement can be a single statement or several in braces.
In the word count program, the one after the else is an if that controls two statements in braces.

Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

Exercise 1-12. Write a program that prints its input one word per line.‚Äù
